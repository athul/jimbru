# Jimbru

Jimbru is an Privacy Oriented web analytics Server which is built with FastAPI and Deta Base as DB.

> Jimbru is heavily inspired by [Shynet](https://github.com/milesmcc/shynet) which is also an Analytics server built with Django.


**Not for Production Level use. It's hacky to the core. I made it for a Personal Use and doesn't have any fancy features.**

## Deploying

Before deploying you need to get some Credentials

### Prep Work
- Signup for an account in https://deta.sh
- Create a new Project 
- Get the Project Key and save it in the `.env` file as below
- [Install](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/cli/install) the Deta cli. This is for deploying to Deta.
- Create a `.env` file inside the `app/routes` directory with the following keys

    ```env
    TITLE=<title of the site>
    DOMAIN=<domain of the deployed server>
    PKEY=<Deta Project Key>
    PNAME=<Deta Base DB Name>
    SECRET_JWT=<Secret for JWT. Get than withâ†’ import os; print(os.urandom(24).hex())>
    USERNAME=<username for authenticating>
    PASSWORD=<password for authenticating>
    ```

> The `PNAME` can be anything.

1. Fork/Clone this Repository
2. You can run the code locally by installing the dependencies inside the `app` directory and running `uvicorn main:app --reload` inside the `app` directory.
3. Inside the `app` directory you can create a new [Micro](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/micros/about) with `$ deta new`. This will create a new Micro. You will get the domian from the output of the command. Save that domain in the `DOMAIN` key in the `.env` file, without a trailing `/`.
4. Run `$ deta update -e routes/.env` to update the environment variables in the micro.
5. Run `$ deta deploy` inside the app directory and the code will be deployed.
6. Profit
